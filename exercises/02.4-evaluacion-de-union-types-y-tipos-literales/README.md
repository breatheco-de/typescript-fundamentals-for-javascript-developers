# `02.4` Evaluation of Union Types and Literal Types

Now, let's assess your understanding with an interactive quiz. Answer carefully, and if you have any doubts, don't hesitate to review the previous lessons. Let's go!

## üìù Evaluation Quiz

1. What is a Union Type in TypeScript?

   - [ ] A type that only allows a specific value.
   - [x] A type that allows a variable to be one of several possible types.
   - [ ] A type that defines an interface with optional properties.
   - [ ] A type that restricts values to numeric literals.

2. What is the main purpose of Literal Types?

   - [ ] To allow any value of a data type.
   - [ ] To define an object structure with specific properties.
   - [x] To restrict the values of a variable to a specific set of options.
   - [ ] To combine multiple types into one.

3. How can you use a Literal Type to manage states in an application?

   - [ ] By allowing a variable to accept any string.
   - [x] By defining a limited set of values such as "active", "inactive", or "pending".
   - [ ] By creating an interface with required properties.
   - [ ] By using it to combine numeric and text types.

4. What happens if you try to assign a value outside of a defined Union Type or Literal Type?

   - [ ] TypeScript accepts it without issues.
   - [ ] The code runs, but shows a warning in the console.
   - [x] TypeScript generates a compile-time error.
   - [ ] The value is automatically converted to the closest type.

Now that you've answered the quiz, it's time to think a bit further. In this mini challenge, I invite you to reflect on how you would apply what you've learned in a real project. There are no wrong answers, I just want you to think creatively!

### Practical Scenario
Imagine you are developing a task application. How would you use **Union Types** and **Literal Types** to model the state of a task and the actions a user can perform? Briefly explain your approach.

```question eval="The student should describe how they would use Union Types and Literal Types in a task application, mentioning at least one example of each applied to the state or actions of a task."
```

Congratulations on completing this assessment! See you in the next lesson, where we will begin to explore Generics in TypeScript.
