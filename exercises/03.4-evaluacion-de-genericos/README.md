# `03.4` Generics Assessment

Congratulations on reaching the final assessment of the generics module in TypeScript! At this point, you have learned about simple generics, how to create generic functions, and how to apply the `ApiResponse<T>` structure to type API responses flexibly. Now it's time to test your knowledge and make sure you can apply these concepts in practical development scenarios.

Below, you will find a series of questions related to the topics we have covered in this module. Read each question carefully and select the correct option. Good luck!

1. What is a generic in TypeScript?

   - [ ] A function that only accepts a specific data type.
   - [x] A mechanism that allows you to create reusable components that work with different data types.
   - [ ] An interface that cannot be modified.
   - [ ] A primitive data type like `string` or `number`.

2. What is the main purpose of the `ApiResponse<T>` structure?

   - [ ] To limit API responses to a single data type.
   - [ ] To increase code complexity without clear benefits.
   - [x] To type API responses flexibly to handle different data types.
   - [ ] To avoid using interfaces in TypeScript.

3. If you define an interface `ApiResponse<T>` with a `data` property of type `T`, what does this mean?

   - [ ] That `data` can only be a `string`.
   - [x] That `data` can be of any type, depending on how `ApiResponse` is used.
   - [ ] That `data` cannot be typed.
   - [ ] That `data` will always be an empty object.

4. What advantage does using generics in a function like `fetchData<T>()` offer?

   - [ ] It makes the function harder to read.
   - [ ] It limits the function to a single return type.
   - [x] It allows the function to return different data types while maintaining type safety.
   - [ ] It eliminates the need to specify types in TypeScript.

You have worked hard to get here! If you have questions about any of the questions or want to delve deeper into a topic, don't hesitate to explore further.
